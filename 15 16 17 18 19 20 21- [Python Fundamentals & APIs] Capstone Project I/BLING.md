## Business Challenge: Cohort Analysis for BLING (Sample Project 1)

### Introduction

BLING, a forward-thinking financial services company, has been offering innovative cash advance solutions since its inception in 2020. With a commitment to providing money advancements for free and transparent pricing, BLING has garnered a substantial user base. As part of their continuous effort to enhance their services and understand user behavior, BLING has commissioned a cohort analysis project.
## Business Challenge: Cohort Analysis for BLING (Sample Project 1)

### Project Overview

In this project, you will conduct a comprehensive cohort analysis based on data provided by BLING. The main objective is to analyze user cohorts defined by the month of creation of their first cash advance. You will track the monthly evolution of key metrics for these cohorts, enabling BLING to gain valuable insights into user behavior and the performance of their financial services.

### Metrics to Analyze

You will calculate and analyze the following metrics for each cohort:

1. **Frequency of Service Usage:** Understand how often users from each cohort utilize BLING's cash advance services over time.

2. **Incident Rate:** Determine the incident rate, specifically focusing on payment incidents, for each cohort. Identify if there are variations in incident rates among different cohorts.

3. **Revenue Generated by the Cohort:** Calculate the total revenue generated by each cohort over months to assess the financial impact of user behavior.

4. **New Relevant Metric:** Propose and calculate a new relevant metric that provides additional insights into user behavior or the performance of BLING's services.

### Data Analysis Tools

You are expected to perform the cohort analysis using Python, primarily leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.  However, the main analysis should be conducted using Python.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before diving into cohort analysis, conduct an exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. Explore key statistics, distributions, and visualizations to identify patterns and outliers. EDA will help you make informed decisions on data preprocessing and analysis strategies.

### Data Quality Analysis

Assess the quality of the dataset by identifying missing values, data inconsistencies, and potential errors. Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability of your analysis. Document any data quality issues encountered and the steps taken to address them.

### Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Provide well-documented Python code that conducts the cohort analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, cohort creation, metric calculation, and visualization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis Report:** Prepare a report summarizing the findings from your exploratory data analysis. Include visualizations and insights that help understand the dataset.

3. **Data Quality Analysis Report:** Document the results of your data quality analysis, highlighting any issues and the steps taken to resolve them.

4. **Short Presentation:** Create a concise presentation (maximum of 4 slides) summarizing your findings from the cohort analysis and key insights gained from EDA and data quality analysis. This presentation should be suitable for sharing with the BLING team.

### Additional Information

BLING is excited to gain insights from this cohort analysis to make data-driven decisions that can enhance their financial services and user experience. Your analysis will play a crucial role in shaping BLING's future strategies.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification on the project. Once completed, we will schedule a presentation or remote meeting to discuss your findings.

Thank you for taking on this project, and we look forward to your valuable contributions.

Best regards,
